1.  Look at the grammar. What changes to the grammar alone could improve the parsing   (in particular, consider coordinated conjunctions)? Modify the grammar somewhat and evaluate the improvements. What new sentences may be parsed? What invalid sentences are now parsed (if any)?


Answer.  (A) We can use the below co-ordinated conjunction rules to improve the grammar. 
                (i) NP → NP and NP
                    
                (ii) VP → VP and VP


                (iii) S → S and S


         (B) New sentences being parsed are: 


		(i)  i and john drive jetcar


		Parse Tree : s [ np [ np [ fpron [ i ] ]fand [ and ]np [ fname [ john ] ] ]vp [ vbar [ vbar [ fv [ drive ] ]np [ nbar [ fn [ jetcar ] ] ] ] ]


		(ii) will you drive and give 


		Parse Tree : s [ faux [ will ]np [ fpron [ you ] ]vp [ vp [ vbar [ fv [ drive ] ] ]fand [ and ]vp [ vbar [ fv [ give ] ] ] ]


		(iii) I give watermelon and drive jetcar


		Parse Tree : s [ np [ fpron [ i ] ]vp [ vp [ vbar [ vbar [ fv [ give ] ]np [ nbar [ fn [ watermelon ] ] ] ] ]fand [ and ]vp [ vbar [ vbar [ fv [ drive ] ]np [ nbar [ fn [ jetcar ] ] ] ] ] ]




   	(C) Below are the grammars which are invalid and getting parsed by the new rules:


        	(i) chicago did drive and give


        	Parse Tree : s [ np [ fname [ chicago ] ] vp [ vp [ vbar [ faux [ did ] fv [ drive ] ] ] fand [ and ] vp [ vbar [ fv [ give ] ] ] ] ]


            	(ii) jetcar and this watermelon drive


        	Parse Tree : Parse tree: s [ np [ np [ nbar [ fn [ jetcar ] ] ] fand [ and ] np [ fd [ this ] nbar [ fn [ watermelon ] ] ] ] vp [ vbar [ fv [ drive ] ] ] ]
